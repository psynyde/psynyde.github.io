Hello, I’m psynyde, and this is my home on the web.

I’m passionate about low-level and systems programming, particularly in Zig and C. I enjoy visualizing algorithms using low-level graphics APIs and building Linux-specific software.

You can find my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/psynyde), and you can contact me via email at pxynyde@proton.me or on X at [@psynyde_](https://x.com/psynyde_).
